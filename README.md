## 🚀 About Me
Hey, I’m Kobi Hanoch, a developer who enjoys turning ideas into software that achieves their core purpose, looks good, and can scale easily.  
I enjoy working on backend architecture and setting things up in the cloud, but I also like building clean UI/UX with **React (NEXT.js as well) and React Native**.

Most of the time, I work with React, React Native, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Docker.  
I’ve built full stack projects like a Pilates booking app and a fitness tracker that includes login, dashboards, and real-time features.

Here’s what I’ve done recently:
- Deployed an instance using **AWS EC2** using **Application Load Balancer** and **Auto Scaling Groups** for studying working with cloud architecture
- Integrated **Redis and BullMQ** for background job processing
- Worked with **Redis cache**, to make data fetchig more efficient
- Used **Docker and Compose** to containerize apps
- Strengthened my skills in **Java OOP** through real university projects
- Spent time learning about **networking** concepts like TCP, UDP, and WebSockets

## 🏆 Core Strengths
- **API development** — includes authentication, role-based access, token refresh logic, and secure flows using **JWT** and **Supabase RLS**
- **System design** — from planning the database to writing backend logic to deploying in Docker
- **Live data features** — built with WebSockets and Redis pub/sub
- **Async workflows** — background processing using queues and modular services
- **Clean, readable code** — structured using **SOLID** principles with proper layering and strict validation using **Zod**

## 🛠️ What I Can Build Today

| 💡 Need | 🏗️ I Deliver |
| --- | --- |
| **Backend systems** | Secure REST APIs with full auth flows, session support, and clear data models |
| **Responsive interfaces** | Built with React, Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui |
| **Mobile apps** | Developed using React Native and Expo |
| **Background jobs** | Powered by Redis and BullMQ |
| **Deployable solutions** | Run with Docker Compose on Render or AWS EC2 |
| **Quick prototypes** | Built using modular code and real-world design patterns |

## 📈 Scaling and Enterprise Mindset
I enjoy learning how large-scale systems are built and maintained. I’ve been applying those ideas to my own side projects and making them more robust.  
Next up: diving into **Kubernetes** with tools like Helm, service meshes, and operators to better manage multi-service deployments.

## 🌟 Featured Projects

| Project | Tech | Live or Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PilatesApp** – *Booking Platform* | React, Node.js, MongoDB, Docker | Hosted on **Render** with full login, schedule booking, and admin tools |
| **StrongTogetherApp** – *Fitness Tracker (React Native)* | React Native, Express, Supabase | My first mobile project — used **Supabase Edge Functions** for backend logic, with features like workout logs, progress view, and data sync |

## 🎯 2025 Focus Points
- Earn the **AWS Certified Developer** title  
- Master **Kubernetes** and learn how to deploy multi-service apps  
- Open source useful tools I’ve built  
- Keep improving my knowledge of **networking and system scaling**
