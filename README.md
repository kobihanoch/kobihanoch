# Hey there! I'm **Kobi Hanoch**, 24 years old 👋

I’m a first-year Computer Science student at **Afeka College** in Tel Aviv, originally from Nes Ziona, Israel. I’m on a mission to become a top-tier Full-Stack developer with a passion for cloud-native and DevOps practices.

## 🧰 What I Work With

* 💻 **JavaScript (ES6+)** — my go-to language for building responsive web and mobile apps.
* 📱 **Frontend:** React, React Native, Next.js — creating seamless interfaces and intuitive user experiences.
* ⚙️ **Backend:** Node.js, Express — designing APIs and managing custom servers (shoutout to Render!). Recently started diving into tokens, HTTPS, Cookies, and CORS to bolster security.
* 🗄️ **Databases & Services:** MongoDB, Supabase (initial experimentation) — structuring and syncing data effectively.
* 🔧 **Tools & Workflows:** Git, NPM, RESTful APIs — ensuring clean code and smooth deployments.
* ☁️ **On My Radar:** AWS, cloud architecture, DevOps fundamentals — gearing up for scalable, resilient systems.
* 🧭 **Next Up:** Redis caching and WebSockets for real-time features — currently exploring through tutorials and mini-projects.
* 🛠️ **DevOps & Learning:** Not yet proficient in DevOps, but eager to dive into CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and formal AWS training soon.
* 🐍 **Python:** introduced during my CS coursework; familiar with basics but focused my projects elsewhere.

## 🚀 My Journey So Far

1. **C# with .NET MAUI:** started my coding path in C#, using .NET MAUI for cross‑platform apps.
2. **Discovering React:** saw how dominant and versatile React is in today’s industry, so I taught myself React and React Native through independent projects.
3. **Self‑led learning:** beyond C# and Python lessons at university, I’ve deepened skills by building projects hands‑on:

   * A **Pilates booking** platform (full-stack)
   * A **barber shop** landing page with WhatsApp integration
   * **Strong Together**, a collaborative fitness tracker in React Native
4. **Backend evolution:** moved from Supabase prototypes to crafting my own **Node.js + Express** servers.
5. **Deployment debut:** launched my first live backend on **Render**, and I’m excited to step into AWS deployments next.

## 🎯 Where I’m Headed

I’m driven to:

* **Master full-stack pipelines** — from frontend UIs to backend services.
* **Embrace DevOps** — implement CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and monitoring.
* **Leverage AWS** — architect cloud-native solutions for high availability.
