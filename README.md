## 🚀 About Me

I'm a hands-on **Full Stack Developer** who loves building real-world apps with clean structure, optimized performance, and scalable architecture.

My strongest tools are **React, React Native, Node.js**, and **cloud-native infrastructure**.  
What sets me apart is the way I **dive deep into internals** - exploring **memoization**, **cache layers**, and **efficient rendering** across both frontend and backend.

💡 I believe modern apps need to be **smart**, **snappy**, and **scalable** - and that’s what I strive to build.

## 🧠 What Makes Me Different

- 🔁 Deep understanding of **memoization in React**, using `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo`, and `lazy rendering` to reduce unnecessary re-renders and boost UI performance.
- 🧠 Designed **multi-layered cache strategies** - from **Redis compression with gzip/base64** on the backend, to **preload/memoize patterns** in React Native using contexts and hooks.
- 🧱 Built scalable and modular APIs with **JWT auth**, and **advanced SQL aggregation logics**.
- 📲 Created fluid, snappy UI experiences with **React Native**, **custom animations**, and **offline-first** patterns.
