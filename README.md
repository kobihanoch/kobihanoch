## 🚀 About Me

I'm a hands-on **Full Stack Developer** who loves building real-world applications with clean structure, optimized performance, and scalable architecture.

My strongest tools are **React, React Native, Node.js**, and **cloud-native infrastructure**.  
What sets me apart is how I **dive deep into internals** - exploring **memoization**, **cache strategies**, and **performance optimizations** across both frontend and backend.

My journey in development began early - I built my first HTML website in **Notepad at the age of 10**, with no fancy IDEs and certainly no AI.  
In high school, I progressed to **C#**, and later expanded my skillset during my Computer Science degree with **Java**, **Python**, and **MIPS Assembly**.

Taking an Assembly course opened my eyes to how deep systems can go - from CPU instructions to memory layout - and made me realize that there's always another layer to understand.  
Since then, I’ve been committed to pushing deeper into the technologies I use - especially in **React**, where I focus on **micro-optimizations**, **manual memoization**, and understanding rendering behavior beyond the surface.

I often choose to **build core logic myself** instead of relying blindly on third-party libraries - not out of ego, but out of curiosity and the desire to **truly understand how things work under the hood**.  
For example, in my mobile app, I developed a custom **SWR-like data layer**, tailored for offline-first caching and real-time sync - giving me full control over fetch lifecycles, validation, and memory usage.

As AI tools evolved, I’ve embraced them thoughtfully - using them where they provide value, but never as a crutch.  
When it comes to **system scaling**, **security**, and **long-term maintainability**, I believe there's no replacement for **human reasoning and deliberate architecture**.  
That’s why I intentionally avoid relying on AI-generated code for **critical features or complex logic** - I prefer to craft them myself with clarity and purpose.

💡 I believe modern apps should be **smart**, **snappy**, and **built to scale** - and that’s exactly what I aim to deliver.

## 🧠 What Makes Me Different

- 🔁 Deep understanding of **memoization in React**, using `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo`, and `lazy rendering` to reduce unnecessary re-renders and boost UI performance.
- 🧠 Designed **multi-layered cache strategies** - from **Redis compression with gzip/base64** on the backend, to **preload/memoize patterns** in React Native using contexts and hooks.
- 🧱 Built scalable and modular APIs with **JWT auth**, and **advanced SQL aggregation logics**.
- 📲 Created fluid, snappy UI experiences with **React Native**, **custom animations**, and **offline-first** patterns.
